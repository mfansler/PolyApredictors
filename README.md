To run EndogenousCleavageSitePrediction.py please make sure you can satisfy the following dependencies: keras version 2.0.6, cPickle version 1.71, joblib version 0.11, pandas version 0.23.4, numpy version 1.14.2, seaborn version 0.7.1. The script loads Supplementary_Table_8.tab and performs cleavage site prediction using each of the three models: cnn, xgb, kmer. For each model, the input is processed according to model requirements, the model is loaded and predictions are run. The predicted values are compared to the ones in Supplementary_Table_8.tab.

To perform new predictions, one can supply a tab delimited file similar to Supplementary_Table_8.tab and input zero for the last column corresponding to measured cleavage site.
